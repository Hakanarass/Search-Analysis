Search Analysis
The program tests the search performance of Array List, Linked List, Hash Map and Binary Search Trees. 
The program generates numbers in the range [1, M] and stores them in an Array list. 
By shuffling these numbers with Collections.shuffle in the Java library, it makes it difficult to find numbers easily. 
Then, the program takes these numbers and records them in the lists. 
Then, program searchs all elements in the increasing order [1, 2, 3, ..., M] and record total search time. 
When the program finishes its operation, the user sees the information on the screen how long it takes to search each list in all steps.
According to the output of the program, we can say that the fastest is the Hash Map. C
ompared to Binary Search Tree, we can say that Hash Map is obviously faster. 
When we look at Array Lists and Linked Lists, there's a serious difference between them. 
Array List works much faster than Linked List. In general;
According to search time:
Linked List > Array List > Binary Search Tree > Hash Map
