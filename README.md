# Search-Analysis
Search Analysis
The program tests the search performance of Array List, Linked List, Hash Map and Binary Search Trees. 
The program generates numbers in the range [1, M] and stores them in an Array list. 
By shuffling these numbers with Collections.shuffle in the Java library, it makes it difficult to find numbers easily. 
Then, the program takes these numbers and records them in the lists. 
Then, program searchs all elements in the increasing order [1, 2, 3, ..., M] and record total search time. 
When the program finishes its operation, the user sees the information on the screen how long it takes to search each list in all steps.
